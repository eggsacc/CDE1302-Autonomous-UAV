# Developer Guide for Turtlebot's Navigation and Mission Coordinator (FSM)

This document describes the high-level design of the navigation and mission control constructs for the Turtlebot ICBM. The system runs across two platforms: the remote PC (laptop) handles navigation and mission coordination, while the Raspberry Pi handles AprilTag detection, dock control, and launcher control. This guide covers the remote PC codebase only.

## Laptop Terminals

**Terminal 1 — SLAM**
```bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger && export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42
ros2 launch turtlebot3_cartographer cartographer.launch.py
```

**Terminal 2 — Nav2**
```bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42
ros2 launch nav2_bringup navigation_launch.py \
  params_file:=$HOME/colcon_ws/src/auto_nav/config/nav2_params_frontier.yaml \
  use_sim_time:=false
```

**Terminal 3 — Navigation**
```bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42 && source ~/colcon_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 run auto_nav nav_final
```

**Terminal 4 — Mission Coordinator**
```bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42 && source ~/colcon_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 run auto_nav mission_coordinator_final
```

**Terminal 5 — Monitor**
```bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42
ros2 topic echo /mission/state
```

## Nav2GapNav Node

**API:** `nav_final.py`

The main navigation control node for the Turtlebot ICBM. It performs autonomous frontier exploration using a gap-first strategy: LiDAR openings are prioritised over map-based frontiers. All path execution is delegated to Nav2 (SmacPlanner2D + MPPIController).

> For algorithm rationale, design decisions, Nav2 configuration, and tuning guidance on when and why to change these values, see [Software_design.md](Software_design.md).

### Methods

**_map_cb:**

- Arguments:
    - `msg` : An OccupancyGrid message from the `/map` topic.
- Returns: None
- Effects: Stores the occupancy grid data as a numpy array and marks the internal costmap as dirty for rebuilding.

**_scan_cb:**

- Arguments:
    - `msg` : A LaserScan message from the `/scan` topic.
- Returns: None
- Effects: Stores the LiDAR range data as a numpy array. Values outside the sensor's valid range are replaced with NaN.

**_nav_cmd_cb:**

- Arguments:
    - `msg` : A String message containing either "pause" or "resume".
- Returns: None
- Effects: Pauses or resumes navigation. Pause is idempotent: it aborts any active backup, cancels any active Nav2 goal, blacklists the current goal, stops the robot, and sets the state to PAUSED. Resume is also idempotent: it clears the current goal and transitions to GAP_SELECT for fresh goal selection.

![_nav_cmd_cb (pause / resume)](../flow_chart_diagrams/_nav_cmd_cb.png)

**_get_pose:**

- Arguments: None
- Returns: A tuple (x, y, yaw) of the Turtlebot3 ICBM's position and heading in the `map` frame, or None if the TF lookup fails. Tries `base_footprint` first, then `base_link`.

**_world_to_map:**

- Arguments:
    - `wx` , `wy` : World coordinates (metres) to convert.
- Returns: A tuple (mx, my) of map cell indices, or None if the coordinates are outside the map bounds.

**_map_to_world:**

- Arguments:
    - `mx` , `my` : Map cell indices to convert.
- Returns: A tuple (wx, wy) of world coordinates corresponding to the centre of the cell.

**_rebuild_costmap:**

- Arguments: None
- Returns: None
- Effects: Inflates all occupied cells in the map by `INFLATION_R` using a box kernel to create the `blocked_grid`. Clears the `map_dirty` flag.

**_grid_blocked:**

- Arguments:
    - `cell` : A tuple (mx, my) of map cell indices, or None.
- Returns: True if the cell is within the inflated costmap (occupied or inflation-padded), False otherwise. Returns False if cell is None or the grid has not been built.

**_arc_min:**

- Arguments:
    - `center_deg` : The centre angle of the arc in degrees (0 = front, 180 = rear).
    - `half_deg` : The half-width of the arc in degrees.
- Returns: The minimum valid LiDAR range within the specified arc, or infinity if no valid readings exist in the arc.

**_calc_info_gain:**

- Arguments:
    - `cx` , `cy` : Map cell indices of the position to evaluate.
- Returns: The number of unknown cells (value == -1) within a square region of side length `2 * LIDAR_RANGE_M / map_res` centred on the given position.

**_ig_ratio:**

- Arguments:
    - `cx` , `cy` : Map cell indices of the position to evaluate.
- Returns: The ratio of unknown cells to the maximum possible area (a circle of radius `LIDAR_RANGE_M`). Used to filter out goals near fully-explored areas.

**_select_gap:**

- Arguments:
    - `rx` , `ry` , `yaw` : The robot's current position (metres) and heading (radians) in the map frame.
- Returns: A tuple (gx, gy) of the best gap goal coordinates, or None if no valid gap exists.
- Effects: Bins LiDAR rays into 20° sectors, takes the median range per sector, marks sectors with median > 1.0 m as open, clusters adjacent open sectors into contiguous openings, discards openings narrower than 40°, places a goal 0.9 m along the opening's centre direction, then validates and scores all candidates.

![_select_gap (gap detection)](../flow_chart_diagrams/_select_gap.png)

**_select_frontier:**

- Arguments:
    - `rx` , `ry` , `yaw` : The robot's current position (metres) and heading (radians) in the map frame.
- Returns: A tuple (gx, gy) of the best frontier goal coordinates, or None if no valid frontier exists.
- Effects: Finds all free cells adjacent to at least one unknown cell. Bins these frontier cells spatially into clusters. For each cluster, selects the cell closest to the centroid as the candidate goal. Filters by distance, blacklist proximity, costmap clearance, info gain ratio, and regional stuck history. Scores candidates by travel efficiency adjusted for heading alignment and cluster size.

**_goal_tick:**

- Arguments: None
- Returns: None
- Effects: The main goal selection loop running at `FRONTIER_HZ`. Publishes the current navigation state. In the `GAP_SELECT` state: rebuilds the costmap if dirty, tries `_select_gap()` first, falls back to `_select_frontier()` if no gap is found. If both fail, clears the normal blacklist and retries. After `NO_FRONTIER_RETRIES` consecutive failures, checks if any frontier cells remain in the map — if none, transitions to DONE. If the state is `NAVIGATING`, checks for goal timeout.

![_goal_tick (goal selection)](../flow_chart_diagrams/_goal_tick.png)

**_send_nav2_goal:**

- Arguments:
    - `gx` , `gy` : The goal coordinates (metres) in the map frame.
    - `rx` , `ry` : The robot's current position (metres), used to compute the goal heading.
- Returns: None
- Effects: Constructs a PoseStamped goal with orientation facing from (rx, ry) toward (gx, gy) and sends it to Nav2 via the NavigateToPose action.

**_on_nav_response:**

- Arguments:
    - `future` : The action response future from Nav2.
- Returns: None
- Effects: Handles Nav2's acceptance or rejection of the goal. If rejected, the goal is blacklisted and state returns to GAP_SELECT (unless paused).

**_on_nav_result:**

- Arguments:
    - `future` : The action result future from Nav2.
- Returns: None
- Effects: Handles Nav2 goal completion. Both success and failure cause the goal to be blacklisted (so the robot moves on to new areas). Transitions to GAP_SELECT unless paused.

**_cancel_nav2_goal:**

- Arguments: None
- Returns: None
- Effects: Cancels the active Nav2 goal if one exists and clears the nav_handle.

**_control_tick:**

- Arguments: None
- Returns: None
- Effects: The stuck detection and backup control loop running at `CONTROL_HZ`. When the state is `NAVIGATING`, it takes periodic position snapshots. If the robot has moved less than `STUCK_DIST` in `STUCK_TIME` seconds, it declares the robot stuck, cancels the Nav2 goal, blacklists the goal, and transitions to `BACKING_UP`. When the state is `BACKING_UP`, it checks rear clearance and either reverses at `BACKUP_SPEED` or nudges forward with a spin if the rear is blocked. After backup completes, the stuck position is added to the stuck-blacklist. If the same region has triggered stuck detection `REGION_STUCK_THRESH` times, the region is buried by adding multiple blacklist entries.

![_control_tick (stuck detection & backup)](../flow_chart_diagrams/_control_tick.png)

**_stop:**

- Arguments: None
- Returns: None
- Effects: Publishes a zero-velocity `Twist` message to `/cmd_vel`, stopping the Turtlebot ICBM.

**_blacklist_goal:**

- Arguments: None
- Returns: None
- Effects: Adds the current `frontier_goal` coordinates and a timestamp to the blacklist. Prunes the blacklist to the most recent `MAX_BLACKLIST` entries. Clears `frontier_goal` and `goal_start_t`.

**_dock_timed_out:**

- Arguments: None
- Returns: True if the current dock+fire cycle has exceeded `DOCK_TIMEOUT_S` seconds since `_dock_start_t` was set. False otherwise.

**_abort_dock_retry:**

- Arguments:
    - `label` : A string label for logging (e.g., 'DOCKING_STATIC', 'FIRING_DYNAMIC').
- Returns: None

**_tick:**

- Arguments: None
- Returns: None
- Effects: The main 20 Hz state machine loop. Publishes the current mission state. Handles all state transitions:
    - **EXPLORING:** Checks for static tags (priority) then dynamic dock tags. If found, calls `_start_docking()`. If both `static_done` and `dynamic_done` are True, transitions to DONE.
    - **DOCKING_STATIC:** Waits for nav to settle, then sends 'dock_static'. If dock reports 'docked', transitions to FIRING_STATIC. If dock is lost beyond debounce, cancels and resumes nav. If dock timeout expires, aborts with retry.
    - **FIRING_STATIC:** Waits for 'static_done' from the launcher. If received, sends 'backup' and transitions to BACKING_UP_STATIC. If dock timeout expires, aborts with retry.
    - **BACKING_UP_STATIC:** Waits for 'backup_done' latch. Sets `static_done = True`, tells detector to ignore static tags, resumes nav, and returns to EXPLORING. In TEST_MODE, enters COOLDOWN instead.
    - **COOLDOWN (TEST_MODE only):** Waits for `STATIC_COOLDOWN_S` seconds, then resets and returns to EXPLORING for re-testing.
    - **DOCKING_DYNAMIC:** Same flow as DOCKING_STATIC but sends 'dock_dynamic'. On success, transitions to WAITING_DYNAMIC.
    - **WAITING_DYNAMIC:** Waits for the 'dynamic_receptacle' tag to appear. If detected, fires one ball and transitions to FIRING_DYNAMIC. If timeout expires, cancels and resumes nav.
    - **FIRING_DYNAMIC:** Waits for 'dynamic_fired' or 'dynamic_done' from the launcher. If `dynamic_balls_fired < DYNAMIC_BALL_COUNT`, returns to WAITING_DYNAMIC for the next ball. Otherwise, sends 'backup' and transitions to BACKING_UP_DYNAMIC.
    - **BACKING_UP_DYNAMIC:** Waits for 'backup_done' latch. Sets `dynamic_done = True`, tells detector to ignore dynamic tags, resumes nav, and returns to EXPLORING.
    - **DONE:** No action.

## Testing guide

To test certain components of the system, it is recommended to use the `TEST_MODE` flag in the mission coordinator.

1. Set `TEST_MODE = True` in `mission_coordinator_final.py`. This enables re-triggering of static targets after a configurable cooldown, allowing repeated dock-and-fire testing without restarting the node.

2. Build the package in the designated workspace.

```bash
$ cd ~/colcon_ws
$ colcon build
$ source install/setup.bash
```

3. Run the nodes as described in the terminal commands above.

4. To test navigation independently (without mission coordination), run only Terminals 1–3. The navigation node will explore autonomously without pausing for docking.

5. To test the mission coordinator's pause/resume integration, publish manual commands:

```bash
$ ros2 topic pub --once /mission/nav_command std_msgs/String "data: 'pause'"
$ ros2 topic pub --once /mission/nav_command std_msgs/String "data: 'resume'"
```
