# Mission Overview & Objectives
### CDE2310 — Fundamentals of Systems Design | AY 2025–26 | Group 12

---

## Mission Overview

Our objective was to modify a **TurtleBot3** platform to perform a series of delivery tasks while autonomously navigating a maze — simulating logistical needs in a warehouse environment.

The TurtleBot system was fitted with an AMR workflow and made capable of **carrying and depositing ping-pong balls** into static and moving receptacles found around the maze. A bonus objective involved using an API call to summon a lift and perform a final delivery sequence at an elevated station.

**Key Constraints:**
- Must use an **RPi Camera** for landmark detection (AprilTag / ArUco markers at targets)
- Must operate **without line-following** techniques to solve the maze

## Problem Definition

From the starting point, the TurtleBot navigates through an unknown zone, mapping its way through walls and obstacles while detecting landmarks to execute deliveries:

| Station | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Station A** *(Fixed)* | Navigate to a fixed station identifiable by pre-deployed markers, dock and align, then fire **3 ping-pong balls** into a biscuit tin following a fixed timing pattern |
| **Station B** *(Dynamic)* | Detect a tin moving horizontally on a track via camera, dock appropriately, and deposit another batch of **3 balls** — timed to the receptacle's motion |
| **Station C** *(Bonus)* | Navigate to the lift lobby, summon the lift via API call, and deliver **3 more balls** into a static receptacle on the upper floor |

## System Requirements Analysis

### Project Deliverables

| Mission Requirement | Project Deliverable |
|---|---|
| Traverse Map Autonomously | The robot builds a map of the maze as it explores the environment |
| Navigate Maze Autonomously | The robot detects and works around obstacles during movement |
| Detect Landmarks | The robot recognises and reads fiducial markers at designated locations |
| Station A | Locate via fixed marker, align for docking, release 3 balls on a timed sequence |
| Station B | Determine movement pattern of station and time ball release accurately |

### Functional Requirements

| Mission Requirement | Functional Requirement |
|---|---|
| Traverse Map Autonomously | The robot shall apply **SLAM** to build and maintain a map in real time |
| Navigate Maze Autonomously | The robot shall use the generated map for path planning and obstacle reaction |
| Detect Landmarks | The robot shall use the **RPi Camera V2 (8MP)** to read markers at each mission location |
| Station A | Combine marker detection with SLAM localisation to align and dispense per the delay pattern, with all balls remaining in the receptacle |
| Station B | Track the oscillating receptacle's marker to predict its position |

### Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Performance** | Complete all required tasks (maze mapping + deliveries to A & B) within **25 minutes**, including setup and cleanup |
| **Reliability** | Perform consistently regardless of maze layout changes, without contacting walls or obstacles |
| **Usability** | Any operator unfamiliar with the system shall be able to use it efficiently |
| **Accuracy** | Position precisely enough at each station to guarantee payload delivery and reliable marker detection |
| **Maintainability** | Major system components shall be accessible for inspection or replacement |
| **Efficiency** | Power consumption shall keep the robot operational throughout the full mission without recharging |

### Constraints

| Category | Constraint |
|---|---|
| **Power** | All tasks must fit within the TurtleBot3 Burger's available battery charge and voltage range |
| **Sensors** | All additional sensors must work within ROS2. No cameras beyond the issued RPi Camera V2 8MP are permitted |
| **Processing** | Algorithm design must account for the Raspberry Pi's constrained CPU and memory |
| **Environment** | Variations in room lighting may affect marker detection accuracy |
| **Cost** | Component choices must fit within the project budget |
| **Markers** | Maximum of **6 markers** permitted; must be placed and removed within 25 minutes without damage |
| **Navigation** | The robot must navigate autonomously — line-following and human-guided mapping are **not permitted** |

## System Overview

### Physical Design

Our primary mechanical modification is a **launcher system powered by a 45N solenoid**. Once the RPi Camera (mounted on the robot) detects a mission objective, the docking sequence is initiated. The solenoid briefly activates to strike a ball into the tin, while the hose feeder deposits the next ball via gravity for the subsequent launch.

### Algorithm

The diagram below shows the high-level logic flow of the mission system — from frontier exploration through AprilTag-based station detection, visual-servo docking, and ball launching, to mission completion.

![Mission Algorithm Flowchart](assets/algorithm_flowchart.png)

**Key logic highlights:**

- The robot runs **Frontier Nav + SLAM** continuously, scanning for station AprilTags.
- On detecting a tag, it classifies the station type (static tag ID 0, or dynamic tag ID 25) and initiates the appropriate docking and firing sequence.
- **Station A (static):** docks via visual servoing on tag ID 0, then fires a 3-shot sequence with fixed inter-shot gaps (4 s, then 6 s).
- **Station B (dynamic):** docks on tag ID 25, then polls for the receptacle tag (ID 15) and fires one ball each time the tag is visible, repeating until 3 balls are deposited.
- After each station is complete, the robot **resumes frontier exploration** and ignores the completed station's tag, searching for any remaining stations.
- Once **all stations are done**, the mission ends.

## Repository Structure

This repository uses two primary branches:

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | Stable, consolidated codebase — project README and final deliverables live here |
| `integration` | Active development branch — all subsystem work is merged here before a final PR into `main` |
